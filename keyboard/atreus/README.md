Atreus keyboard firmware
======================

Firmware for the [Atreus](http://atreus.technomancy.us), A 40% column-staggered ergo keyboard.

Run `make KEYMAP=qwerty` or whatever keymap you'd like.

See https://github.com/technomancy/atreus and
[this geekhack thread](http://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=54759.0).

There's
[custom firmware for the Atreus](https://github.com/technomancy/atreus-firmware)
which is a lot simpler and more readable, but this is a lot more
featureful.
